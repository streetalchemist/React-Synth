#React Synth

React Synth is a React based modular synthesizer using the WebAudio API.

Initially created as a personal project to learn React, I decided to turn this into an open source project as I'm really enthusiastic about modular synths in the physical world and would love to see lots of web-based modules built to see how we can push the limits of WebAudio.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). For all major deployment instructions check the guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Getting Started

To get the project running run `npm install` and `npm start` which will serve the project in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

To build the project, run `npm run build` which builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

See the Create React App [guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) for more information.
